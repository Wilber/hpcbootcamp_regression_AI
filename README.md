# Introduction to Regression Analysis and Applications to AI
This tutorial will explore how regression techniques are applied in artificial intelligence (AI) to make predictions, uncover patterns, and optimize models. You will learn the basics of regression analysis, a foundational statistical method used to model relationships between variables. You will build linear regression models as basic introduction to supervised learning, followed by multi-layered Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to predict values of a dependent variable given values of a set of independent (predictor) variables.
